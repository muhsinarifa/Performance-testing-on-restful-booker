# Performance-testing-on-restful-booker
Dear,

Iâ€™ve completed the performance testing on  **restful-booker API**.

Test executed for the below-mentioned scenario in server [Restful-booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/).

**1. 100 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 10 And Total Concurrent API requested: 600.**

**2. 200 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 14 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1200.**

**3. 300 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 30 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1800.**

**4. 400 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 40 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2400.**

While executing 400 concurrent requests, I found 10 requests got connection timeout, and the error rate is 0.42%.

Summary: The server can handle almost a concurrent 2100 API calls with almost zero (0) error rate.
